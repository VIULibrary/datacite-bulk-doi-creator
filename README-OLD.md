## DataCiteAPI-DOIs-from-CSV... Jupyter Notebook and python files

Original code was created by Scotty Carlson and adapted by Kelsey George in Jupyter Notebooks to suit UNLV Library needs. Python scripts allow users to immediately publish DOIs in batch to DataCite Production using metadata from a csv file, "RandomSuffix" will generate a random two-part string as a suffix for the DOI. "Defined Suffix" allows you to pull a suffix of your choosing from your csv metadata.
